### Dashboards for VMware

##### Notes:
- This integration is not for the [Preview Cloud Operations agent for Google Cloud VMware Engine](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/vmware-engine/monitor-your-vmware-instances-in-google-cloud) and this integration is deprecated for that use case.
- [Bindplane](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/blue-medora) needs to be configured for some dashboards.
- For a detailed list of all the metrics and set up information, you can find documentation [here](https://docs.bindplane.bluemedora.com/docs/vmware-vcenter).
