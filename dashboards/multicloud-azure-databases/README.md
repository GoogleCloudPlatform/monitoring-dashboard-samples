### Dashboards for Microsoft Azure Databases

### Notes

- These metrics are supplied from [BindPlane's integration for Microsoft Azure Databases](https://docs.bindplane.bluemedora.com/docs/microsoft-azure-databases)
- This source is generally high level but also has incredibly important metrics and is useful for monitoring the different database engines across a Azure account.

|This dashboard has 4-5 charts dependent on the database engines running for Azure, including metrics like `Storage Usage`, `Storage Used Bytes`, `Memory Usage` (for Postgres and MySQL engines), `CPU Usage`, and `I/O Usage`.|
