    description: |-
      This dashboard has 4-5 charts dependent on the database engines running for Azure, including metrics like Storage Usage, Storage Used Bytes, Memory Usage (for Postgres and MySQL engines), CPU Usage, and I/O Usage.

      These metrics are supplied from [BindPlane's integration for Microsoft Azure Databases](https://docs.bindplane.bluemedora.com/docs/microsoft-azure-databases)

      This source is generally high level but also has incredibly important metrics and is useful for monitoring the different database engines across an Azure account.
