  display_name: UseCase(payment) Monitoring
  description: |-
    This dashboard has 16 charts to demonstrate how we can monitor the payment use case. 
    The first 15 charts include the metrics from the load balancer and all the related microservices in the scenario. 
    The last chart demonstrates how we can monitor application errors using a [log based metric](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/logs-based-metrics) 
    (the metric has to be created first in order to be used in the chart) 
    
    Note: [Istio metrics](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_istio) are used. Please make sure Istio is installed and configured for your cluster.
