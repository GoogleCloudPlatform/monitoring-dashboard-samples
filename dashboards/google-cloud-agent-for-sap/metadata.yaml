    description: "This dashboard is based on [Google Cloud’s Agent for SAP](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/sap/docs/agent-for-sap/latest/planning). It provides an overview of the availability of an SAP HANA system. The availability of a standalone SAP HANA system is derived from the status of the instance's services, such as `hdbindexserver` and `hdbnameserver`. For highly-available SAP HANA deployments, the availability is also derived from the replication status between the primary and secondary sites, and also shows the status of the individual Pacemaker resource agents."
