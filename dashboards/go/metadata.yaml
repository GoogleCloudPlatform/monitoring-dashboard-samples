      This dashboard is based on Prometheus metrics exposed by Go the runtime via [Prometheus client_golang's (version 1.20.0+) default Go Collector metrics](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang/blob/main/examples/gocollector/main.go) and collected by the Prometheus-compatible collection e.g. [Google Managed Service for Prometheus](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus).
