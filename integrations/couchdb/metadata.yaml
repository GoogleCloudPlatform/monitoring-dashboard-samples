description: 'The Apache CouchDB integration collects traffic-related metrics, such
  as the

  number of requests to a node and responses from the node. It also collects

  database metrics, such as how many are open and the number of operations. The

  integration collects general CouchDB and access logs and parses them into a JSON

  payload. The result includes fields for user, host, level, and message.
