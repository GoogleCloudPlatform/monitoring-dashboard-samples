    The Apache CouchDB integration collects traffic-related metrics, such as the
    number of requests to a node and responses from the node. It also collects
    database metrics, such as how many are open and the number of operations. The
    integration collects general CouchDB and access logs and parses them into a JSON
    payload. The result includes fields for user, host, level, and message.
