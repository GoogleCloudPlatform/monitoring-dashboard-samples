  - 'The Apache CouchDB integration collects traffic-related metrics, such as the

    number of requests to a node and responses from the node. It also collects

    database metrics, such as how many are open and the number of operations. The

    integration collects general CouchDB and access logs and parses them into a JSON

    payload. The result includes fields for user, host, level, and message.
