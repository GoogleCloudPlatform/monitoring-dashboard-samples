    The nginx integration collects connection metrics and access logs. Connection
    metrics capture the current state of the connection: active, reading, or
    waiting. Access logs are parsed for their connection details, which include
    fields mapped to request, client, server, and message.

    For more information about nginx, see
    [nginx.org](http://nginx.org/).
