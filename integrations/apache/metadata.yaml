    The Apache Web Server integration collects traffic-related metrics, such as the
    number of open connections or incoming requests. The integration also collects
    access and error logs. Access logs are parsed into a JSON payload focused on
    request details, and error logs are parsed for their error code and message.

    For more information about Apache Web Server, see
    [http://httpd.apache.org/](http://httpd.apache.org/).
