description: 'The Apache Solr integration collects core and cache metrics. Core metrics
  focus

  on requests, document count, and index size. Cache metrics focus on cache

  utilization. The integration also collects Solr logs and parses them into a

  JSON payload. The result includes fields for shard, replica, core,

  level, and message.
