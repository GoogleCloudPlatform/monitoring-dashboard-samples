description: 'The Redis integration collects metrics related to performance and usage.

  Performance metrics focus on CPU, memory, and network throughput, and usage

  metrics focus on keys, commands, and replication. The integration also collects

  Redis logs and parses them into a JSON payload. During this process, the

  symbols for role and level are transformed into a human readable format.
