description: 'The {{ plugin_name }} integration collects performance metrics related
  to

  InnoDB, the buffer pool, and various other operations. It also collects general,

  error, and slow-query logs and parses them into a JSON payload. Error logs are

  parsed for their error code and subsystem. Slow-query logs are parsed into

  key-value pairs that describe the performance of a query, including query time

  and rows examined.
