description: 'The Varnish integration collects cache and session metrics.

  It monitors the number of objects entering and exiting the cache,

  as well as the number of sessions and backend connections.

  The integration also collects Varnish logs and parses them

  into a standardized json payload.

  For more information about Varnish, see

  [Varnish HTTP Cache](https://varnish-cache.org/).'
