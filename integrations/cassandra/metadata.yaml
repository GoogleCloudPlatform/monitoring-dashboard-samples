  - 'The Apache Cassandra integration collects request, task, and storage metrics

    that highlight the load on an instance. Optionally, the integration can also

    collect general JVM metrics related to memory and garbage collection. The

    integration also collects system, debug, and garbage-collection logs. These logs

    are parsed into a JSON payload, which includes fields for the message, Java

    class, and line number.
