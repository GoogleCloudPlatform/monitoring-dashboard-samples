description: 'The Apache Cassandra integration collects request, task, and storage
  metrics

  that highlight the load on an instance. Optionally, the integration can also

  collect general JVM metrics related to memory and garbage collection. The

  integration also collects system, debug, and garbage-collection logs. These logs

  are parsed into a JSON payload, which includes fields for the message, Java

  class, and line number.
