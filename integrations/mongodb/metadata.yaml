description: 'The MongoDB integration primarily collects database metrics, such as
  the number

  of operations and objects, as well as resource usage. The integration also

  collects logs and parses them into a JSON payload. The result includes fields

  for context, component, level, and message.


  Note: Metrics for MongoDB are collected on a per-collection level.

  A _collection_ is a group of documents and is analogous to a table in

  a relational database. A MongoDB integration with a high number of

  collections will produce a high volume of metrics, which can have cost

  implications.'
