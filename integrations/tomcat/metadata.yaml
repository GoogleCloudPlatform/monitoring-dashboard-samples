    The Apache Tomcat integration collects traffic-related metrics, such as the
    number of active sessions or network throughput. The integration also collects
    access and Catalina logs. Access logs are parsed into a JSON payload
    focused on request details, whereas Catalina logs are parsed for general
    details. The `tomcat` receiver collects telemetry from the Tomcat server's Java
    Virtual Machine (JVM) via [JMX](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javamanagement.html).
