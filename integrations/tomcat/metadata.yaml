description: 'The Apache Tomcat integration collects traffic-related metrics, such
  as the

  number of active sessions or network throughput. The integration also collects

  access and Catalina logs. Access logs are parsed into a JSON payload

  focused on request details, whereas Catalina logs are parsed for general

  details. The `tomcat` receiver collects telemetry from the Tomcat server''s Java

  Virtual Machine (JVM) via [JMX](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javamanagement.html).'
