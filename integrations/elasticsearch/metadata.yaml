    Elasticsearch is an open-source search server, based on the
    [Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/) search library. It runs in a Java virtual
    machine on top of a number of operating systems. The `elasticsearch` receiver
    collects node- and cluster-level telemetry from your Elasticsearch instances.
    For more information, see
    [elasticsearch.org](http://elasticsearch.org/).
