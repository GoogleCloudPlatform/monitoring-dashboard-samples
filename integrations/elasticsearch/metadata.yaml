description: 'Elasticsearch is an open-source search server, based on the

  [Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/) search library. It runs in a Java virtual

  machine on top of a number of operating systems. The `elasticsearch` receiver

  collects node- and cluster-level telemetry from your Elasticsearch instances.


  Note: This document refers only to the support for Elasticsearch 7.9+ versions.

  For information about later versions, see

  [Elasticsearch 8.0+ and 9.0+](/stackdriver/docs/solutions/agents/ops-agent/third-party/elasticsearch9).

  The most significant difference between the two documents is in the names of some
  of the log fields.'
