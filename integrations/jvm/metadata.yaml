    The JVM integration collects JVM metrics exposed through [Java Management
    Extensions (JMX)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javamanagement.html).
    The integration primarily collects metrics on memory and garbage collection.
    Additional runtime metrics, such as thread count and classes loaded, are also
    available.
