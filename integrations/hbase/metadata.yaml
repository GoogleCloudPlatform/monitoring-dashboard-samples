description: 'The Apache HBase integration collects cluster metrics from `master`
  and region

  servers. Region server metrics are related to storage as well as request and

  latency. The integration also collects `master` and region server logs and

  parses them into a JSON payload. The result includes fields for source, level,

  and message.
