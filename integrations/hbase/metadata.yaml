- description: |-
    The Apache HBase integration collects cluster metrics from `master` and region
    servers. Region server metrics are related to storage as well as request and
    latency. The integration also collects `master` and region server logs and
    parses them into a JSON payload. The result includes fields for source, level,
    and message.

    For more information about HBase, see
