  display_name: Apache - high server error rate
  description: "The server error rate is derived from processing access logs status
    code. The server error rate value is the number of 5xx status codes per 5 minute
    window. When the server error rate spikes suddenly, then you have a high priority
    server problem as backends are experiencing 5xx errors and clients are not being
    served successfully."

  display_name: Apache - low request rate
  description: "The request rate is derived from the requests metrics taken as a rate
    of every 5 minutes. This value should be monitored beforehand to understand what
    qualifies as a normal request rate so a threshold can be established. When the
    request rate is below the established threshold, then that means there is an environment
    problem that is limiting the request rates."

    qualifies as a normal request rate so a threshold can be established. When the

    spike in traffic which logs can help diagnose if these are nefarious requests
    being made."
