    "content": "The request rate is derived from the requests metrics taken as a rate over a 5 minute interval. This value should be monitored beforehand to understand what qualifies as a normal request rate so a threshold can be established. When the request rate is above this threshold, then that means there is a large spike in traffic, which may be diagnosed by viewing the access logs.",
