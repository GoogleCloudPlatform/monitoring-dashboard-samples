### Creating Notification Channels and User Labels

Whether these alert policies are being used as standalones or base templates for a deployment strategy like Terraform, one thing that should be utilized is notification channels and user labels.

### User Labels

Supplying user labels could give extra identification information about the firing alert:

i.e.

```json
    "userLabels": {
        "datacenter": "central"
    }
```

#### Notification Channels

The ID of the notification channel to be notified.

```json
    "notificationChannels": [
        "projects/project-id/notificationChannels/1234567"
    ]
```
