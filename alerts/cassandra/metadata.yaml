  id: high-read-latency
  display_name: Cassandra - High Read Latency
  description: "Read latency is generally considered the slower operation in Cassandra
     due to hardware limitations or the data model. Read latency is a good indicator
     of how well those affectors are fitting to the Cassandra environment and if
     read latency is high, it might be time to update the hardware or dig deeper
     into why Cassandra is losing performance. Feel free to tune this alert for your
     hardware and latency tolerance, but 4000 millis was the initial threshold specified
     in this alert. For this alert the median 50th percentile was chosen."

  id: high-throughput
  display_name: Cassandra - High Write Throughput
  description: "This Alert generally is looking at unexpected increases of throughput
    in the Cassandra requests. The threshold will be mostly determined based off normalcy
    of the environment the node is in, but the alert is defaulted to 20000 writes-per-second.
    Feel free to adjust threshold to fit your environment. It is generally good to
    keep an eye on the number of write requests going into detect any anomalies in
    either lack of writes or overbearance of rights.

  display_name: Cassandra - High Error Rate
  description: "This alert policy looks at the amount of requests made and the amount
    of errors received. An alert is triggered alerts if the number of exceptions exceeds
    10% of the total amount of requests. Things captured in this alert could include
    timeouts, write exceptions, unavailable exceptions, etc. These generally require
    further investigation and indicate an issue with the Cassandra node."
