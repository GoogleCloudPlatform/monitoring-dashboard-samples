- id: connections-dropped
  display_name: Nginx - connections dropped
  description: Connections dropped value is derived from the connections accepted
    minus the connections handled. This value should be near 0. When this value is
    rising, then this means you may have a resource saturation problem.

- id: high-server-error-rate
  display_name: Nginx - high server error rate
  description: The server error rate is derived from processing access logs status
    code. The server error rate value is the number of 5xx status codes per 5 minute
    window. When the server error rate spikes suddenly, then you have a high priority
    server problem as backends are experiencing 5xx errors and clients are not being
    served successfully.

- id: low-request-rate
  display_name: Nginx - low request rate
  description: The request rate is derived from the requests metrics taken as a rate
    of every 5 minutes. This value should be monitored beforehand to understand what
    qualifies as a normal request rate so a threshold can be established. When request
    rate is below this threshold, then that means there is an environment problem
    that are limiting the request rates.

- id: high-request-rate
  display_name: Nginx - high request rate
  description: The request rate is derived from the requests metrics taken as a rate
    of every 5 minutes. This value should be monitored beforehand to understand what
    qualifies as a normal request rate so a threshold can be established. When request
    rate is above this threshold, then that means there is a large spike in traffic
    which logs can help diagnose if these are nefarious requests.
