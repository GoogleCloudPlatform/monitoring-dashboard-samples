If alerts tend to be false positive or noisy, consider visiting the alert policy page and changing the threshold, the rolling (alignment) window, and the retest (duration) window. [View Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerts/concepts-indepth).\n- We recommend troubleshooting this incident with the [interactive playbook](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/dashboards/gke-troubleshooting/crashloop?project=${PROJECT_ID}&f.sd_ts_playbook.cluster_name=${CLUSTER_NAME}&f.sd_ts_playbook.location=${CLUSTER_LOCATION}) for restarting containers, which shows detailed instructions, metrics, and logs.",
