  display_name: Couchdb - high server error rate
  description: "The server error rate is derived from processing access logs status
    code. The server error rate value is the number of 5xx status codes per 5 minute
    window. When the server error rate spikes suddenly, then you have a high priority
    server problem as backends are experiencing 5xx errors and clients are not being
    served successfully."

  display_name: Couchdb - low request rate
  description: "The request rate is derived from the requests metrics taken as a rate
    of every 5 minutes. This value should be monitored beforehand to understand what
    qualifies as a normal request rate so a threshold can be established. When request
    rate is below this threshold, then that means there is an environment problem
    that are limiting the request rates."

    of every 5 minutes. This value should be monitored beforehand to understand what
    qualifies as a normal request rate so a threshold can be established. When request
    rate is above this threshold, then that means there is a large spike in traffic
    which logs can help diagnose if these are nefarious requests."
